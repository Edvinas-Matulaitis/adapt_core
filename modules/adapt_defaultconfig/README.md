#Adapt Defaultconfig

Contains extensions to the Defaultconfig module. Makes it possible to export settings that aren't supported by Defaultconfig core, such as image styles, languages, content types, ...

###Functionalities

#####Reset configuration

Defaultconfig offers the option to rebuild all configuration, restoring settings to their original state as they are defined in the install profile. This must be used with caution, obviously. See /admin/structure/defaultconfig.
