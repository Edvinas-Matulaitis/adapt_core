adapt_slider
============

Creates the following:

* Content type Slide + image & link field
* View
* Flexslider option set
* Three image styles
* Permissions and variables for this new content type

The created View uses Flexslider as library to make a slideshow. Slides in the
slideshow are rendered as Content, using the Full Content view mode.
This slideshow can easily be made responsive by adding cs_adaptive_image and
using the created image styles.
